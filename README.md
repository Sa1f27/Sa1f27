## 👋 About Me

AI Developer experienced in building scalable, modular systems and end-to-end AI pipelines. Skilled in applying LLMs, NLP, RAG, and Generative AI to production-focused projects. Developed AI systems using vector search, REST/WebSocket APIs, and containerized cloud deployment with an emphasis on reliable architecture and efficient workflows.

**What I Do:**
- Advanced RAG Systems — hybrid retrieval, vector search, knowledge graphs
- LLM Engineering — prompt orchestration, fine-tuning, multi-agent workflows
- API Development — REST, WebSocket, GraphQL using FastAPI with production-grade design
- Production ML — Dockerized services, CI/CD pipelines, cloud deployments
- Multimodal AI — Computer Vision (YOLO, OpenCV), NLP, OCR pipelines

**How I Work:**
- Lead and collaborate with teams to architect scalable solutions
- Design robust APIs that handle real-time communication and high-traffic workflows
- Communicate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences
- Bridge the gap between research and production deployment
